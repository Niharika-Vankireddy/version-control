	<h1>What is a version control system?</h1>

<p>A version control system or VCS, also know as revision control or source control system, 
is a software utility that tracks and manages changes to a filesystem. 
A VCS also offers collaborative utilities to share and integrate these filesystem
 changes to other VCS users. When operating at the filesystem level, 
a VCS will track the addition, deletion, and modification actions applied to files and directories. 
A repository is a VCS term which describes when VCS is tracking a filesystem. In the scope of individual source code files,
 a VCS will track additions, deletions, modifications of the lines of text within that file. 
Popular software industry VCS options include Git, Mercurial, SVN and preforce.

<h2>Why do i need version control software?</h2>

<p>VCS is an invaluable tool with many benefits to a collaborative software team workflow. 
Any software project that has more than one developer maintaining source code files should absolutely use a VCS. 
Additionally, sole-maintainer projects will also greatly benefit from utilizing a VCS. 
There is arguably no valid reason to forgo the use of a VCS in any modern software development project.
